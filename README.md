# Grocery-Management Application

Shopping List SPA that allows a user to enter multiple stores and create shopping lists for each store, with fields for quantity, price, link, aisle and brand for each shopping list item.

The user can also create new objects (stores and grocery item), read their lists, update their lists, and delete items as necessary.

This application was created by Rainie Dormanen (rd16) and Genevieve Larkins (gtl16).

Rainie worked on creating the entities and their properties, and helped with delete function.

Genevieve worked on the add, update, and delete functionalities.
