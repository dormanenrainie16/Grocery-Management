# Grocery-Management Application

Shopping List SPA that allows a user to enter multiple stores and create shopping lists for each store, with fields for quantity and brand for each shopping list item.

The user can also create new objects (stores and grocery item), read their lists, update their lists, and delete items as necessary.
