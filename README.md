# Grocery-Management Application

Shopping List SPA that allows a user to enter multiple stores and create shopping lists for each store, with fields for quantity, price, link, aisle and brand for each shopping list item.

The user can also create new objects (stores and grocery item), read their lists, update their lists, and delete items as necessary.

This application was created by Rainie Dormanen (rd16) and Genevieve Larkins (gtl16).

Both Genevieve and Rainie worked on all parts of Assignment 5 together

Only one laptop could install the SSMS database, so we had to work on the same computer and before VisualStudio stopped working we had a bunch of migration linking errors and using library errors, so the code that we wrote is what we thought would work based off of the code walkthrough videos.
